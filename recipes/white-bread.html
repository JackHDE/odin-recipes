    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>A great recipe for an electric breadmaker or do it the traditional way</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>500G Strong White Flour</li>
        <li>2 TSP Salt</li>
        <li>7G Sachet Fast Action Yeast</li>
        <li>3 TBSP Olive Oil</li>
        <li>300ML Water</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Step 1 - Mix 500g strong white flour, 2 tsp salt and a 7g sachet of fast-action yeast in a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Step 2 - Make a well in the centre, then add 3 tbsp olive oil and 300ml water, and mix well. If the dough seems a little stiff, add another 1-2 tbsp water and mix well.</li>
        <li>Step 3 - Tip onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for around 10 mins.</li>
        <li>Step 4 - Once the dough is satin-smooth, place it in a lightly oiled bowl and cover with cling film. Leave to rise for 1 hour until doubled in size or place in the fridge overnight.</li>
        <li>Step 5 - Line a baking tray with baking parchment. Knock back the dough (punch the air out and pull the dough in on itself) then gently mould the dough into a ball.</li>
        <li>Step 6 - Place it on the baking parchment to prove for a further hour until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>Step 7 - Heat oven to 220C/fan 200C/gas 7.</li>
        <li>Step 8 - Dust the loaf with some extra flour and cut a cross about 6cm long into the top of the loaf with a sharp knife.</li>
        <li>Step 9 - Bake for 25-30 mins until golden brown and the loaf sounds hollow when tapped underneath. Cool on a wire rack.</li>
    </ol>
